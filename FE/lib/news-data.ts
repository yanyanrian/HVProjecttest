      "Monad's testnet has reached a milestone this week with the public rollout of on-chain AI trading agents. The new AgentRegistry contract lets any developer register a bot, post a fee, and start receiving delegated USDC from vault holders.",
      "Because Monad parallelizes execution across cores, the team estimates that registries can settle hundreds of rebalance transactions per second without the gas volatility that plagues L1 deployments. Early integrators are reporting sub-cent settlement costs on routine harvests.",
      "Hypervault's delegation vault contract is one of the first to go live against the registry. Delegators keep custody of principal and can withdraw at epoch boundaries, while agents only ever touch trading balances — a model borrowed from traditional managed accounts.",
      "Next up on the roadmap: reputation scoring, whitelisted swap routers, and a dispute window for agents that breach their declared strategy.",

      "Gold opened the week under pressure, slipping back through $4,180 after a hotter-than-expected US jobs print lifted real yields across the curve. Short-term momentum models on the FX desk have flipped to a NEGATIVE/HOLD stance on XAUT.",
      "The 20-day average, which acted as support through the end of Q1, has now turned into resistance. A close back above $4,230 would invalidate the bearish set-up, but until then agents are reducing gross exposure.",
      "Tuesday's CPI release is the main event risk. A core print above 3.4% YoY would likely extend the pullback, while a softer surprise could trigger a rotation back into precious metals and rate-sensitive majors.",

      "USD/JPY pushed higher through the Asia session as widening rate differentials continue to favour the Dollar. Our FX agent flipped to POSITIVE/HOLD on JPYm late last week and has maintained that stance.",
      "Intervention risk remains the obvious counter-argument. MoF officials reiterated they are watching markets with 'high urgency,' but the pair's steady grind — rather than a disorderly spike — has so far given authorities little reason to act.",
      "For delegators, the takeaway is that short-JPYm, long-USDm spreads have produced a 4.2% rolling 30-day return net of fees. Sizing remains capped at 1% of vault balance per position.",

      "Liquidity providers on Carbon DeFi are seeing the highest realized yields in months. The MON/USDGLO strategy vault reported an effective 149.06% APR over the last seven days as trading volume on the pair more than doubled.",
      "The move follows a regulatory approval for USDGLO in two additional Latin American markets, which drove a one-off conversion wave through Mon's on-chain FX rails. Fee capture on the concentrated range vault has been the primary contributor to APR.",
      "Yield agents subscribed to this market are auto-compounding fees every epoch and rotating 30% of rewards into stMON LP, where base APR still sits around 38.3%. That splits exposure between a higher-beta trading pool and a stickier staking position.",
      "Delegators should note that elevated APRs on concentrated liquidity can decay quickly once the liquidity rush arrives. Position sizing and a disciplined un-wind schedule remain the primary risk controls.",
